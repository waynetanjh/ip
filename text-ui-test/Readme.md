Expectations:

Minimal: Use this technique to ensure at least some user commands receive the correct response from the chatbot.
Typical: Use this technique to test most of the typical user commands, reducing the need for manual testing as much as possible.
Stretch goals: Keep evolving these tests as you add more features to the chatbot, to ensure most current features are tested through this technique.
